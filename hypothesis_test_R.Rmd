## Steps of Hypothesis Testing 

Setup hypothesis and determine of significance  

  - setup null hypothesis from the population mean  
  - setup alternative hypothesis  
  - setup appropriate significance level, alpha 

Determine critical value(zalpha) of the test on alpha(level of significance).  

 - if |Z| < Zalpha, Z is not significant and the null hypothesis may be accepted. 
 - if |Z| >= Zalpha, Z is significant and the null hypothesis is rejected.
